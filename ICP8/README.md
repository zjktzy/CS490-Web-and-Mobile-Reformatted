# ICP3 README / WIKI

Description:

In this ICP I created a simple application in which users can log in and log out.

## RPS Task

notes: <br>
My login screen is basic and easy to use

##### Welcome Screen Screenshot

notes: <br>
my welcome screen is essentially a placeholder where an actual activity would go. <br>
in this case, the user is only able to log out

##### MainActivity Java Screenshot

notes: <br>
The primary function of this app is validateCredentials.<br>
This function will check that the user has entered valid credentials and navigate them to the next screen, or provide an error message depending on the validation flag


##### HomeActivity Java Screenshot

notes: <br>
HomeActivity only has one function which only serves to navigate the user back to the login page.
